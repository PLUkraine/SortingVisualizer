# SeeHowItSortsItself
This project is an attempt to visualize how sorting algorithms work.

You can put up to 4 algorithms in a window and start sorting the same array simultaneously.

This project can visualize any algorithm that uses swap operation. You can write new sorting algorithm and add it to the program without recompile - just load it after the program starts!
## Build
Be sure to use Java 8 compiler. Obviously, you use IDE if you want.

Tests use JUnit 4 library. You don't need to add it if you only want to use this application!
## Run
Main class is *ua.plukraine.MainFrame* class.

Have fun with using this project!
